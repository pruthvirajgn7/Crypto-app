# Crypto-app

– Developed a Crypto Currency Tracker web application which enables user to track prices of crypto currency using React Js, Material UI, React Chart-Js-2, and Context API
– Data has been imported from Coin Gecko website from Single Coin API , Coin List API , Historical chart Displaying API , Trending Coins API
– features include tracking individual coins, showing the trending coins in past 24 hours, Historic chart data of individual coins.
- used material UI for organising data correctly in the app, like showing only top-10 trending coins and we can navigate to next 10 trending coins.
- every coin has its main details in the left part and the historical graph in the right part of the page.
- historical graph can be viewed in 3 different formats daywise, monthwise,yearwise
- this project is yet to be added firebase which will make our app to use realtime login and more.
- this is just a small brief details about the project.
